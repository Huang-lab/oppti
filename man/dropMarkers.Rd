\usage{
dropMarkers(dat, percent_NA = 0.2, low_mean_and_std = 0.05,
q_low_var = 0.25, force_drop = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{an object of log2-normalized gene (or protein) expressions,
containing markers in rows and samples in columns.}

\item{percent_NA}{a constant in [0,1], is the percentage of missing values
that will be tolerated in the filtered data.}

\item{low_mean_and_std}{a constant in [0,inf], is the lower-bound of the
mean or standard deviation of a marker in the filtered data.}

\item{q_low_var}{a constant in [0,1], is the quantile of marker variances
which serves as a lower-bound of the marker variances in the filtered data.}

\item{force_drop}{character array containing the marker names that user
specifically wants to filter out}
}
\value{
data_filtered, with same class as the input data;
dropped_marker_names, rownames (markers) of the data that are filtered out
due to low-expression or low-variability.
}
\description{
Filters out markers based on the percentage of missing values,
low-expression and low-variability rates.
}
